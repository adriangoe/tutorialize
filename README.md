# Tutorialize

Tutorialize is a Student Driven Initiative developed within 24hrs to empower students at MSKGI to coordinate topic and group assignments ahead of their Senior Tutorials and was used to group ~120 students in their preferred group assignments and topics in Spring 2018.

The platform is designed to empower students and give them control over which peers they'd like to work with, while maximizing transparency and reducing awkwardness due to one-sided incompatibility.

## Django

Tutorialize is built on top of the django admin interface and only accessible with an MSKGI email address.
